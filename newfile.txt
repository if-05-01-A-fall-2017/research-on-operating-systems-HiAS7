Chrome OS is an operating system designed by Google, that uses Google Chrome as its principal user interface.
Its main focus therefore is supporting web applications.
The basic idea of Chrome OS is easily using web applications, for example Google Mail or Google Drive.
This approach is opposed to the classic approach of native applications, which are locally installed and
can be used offline. For this reason, Chrome OS always needs an internet connection to work, 
making it primarily suitable for netbooks. Netbooks running Chrome OS are called Chromebooks.
There are also the Chromebox, which is a desktop-PC running Chrome OS, the Chromebase, which is basically
an all-in-one-PC running Chrome OS and the Chromebit, which is a HDMI dongle, that turns a monitor or television set 
into a personal computer.
Over the years, Chrome OS got an integrated mediaplayer and an integrated file manager, as well as
Chrome Apps and Android applications, which partly eliminate the need for a constant internet connection.
The main appeal of Chrome OS, that it is a very lightweight operating system, which will start in under seven seconds.
Other advantages are, that Chromebooks tend to be rather inexpensive.
